MNIST Classification with a Deep CNN

There are a number of arbitrarily chosen values within the program that you can feel free to change and toy with. They're all just stored globally at the top of the file. FILE\_NAME sets the tmp/FILE\_NAME directory where TensorFlow stores checkpoints for the network. To start training again from scratch, either clear out that file, or change FILE\_NAME to an unused directory path.

A NIPS formatted paper can be found at Paper/nips_2018.tex within this repository.
